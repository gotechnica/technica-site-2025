    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <div style="margin-top: 2rem;"></div>
    <p>
      Each of Technica's five tracks are designed to best accomodate a hacker's
      interests and skill level, and will have track-specific mentors for
      support and guidance during the hackathon. During registration, hackers
      will select the track that they feel best aligns with their goals for the
      hackathon.
      <br>
      <br>
      During the weeks leading up to Technica, there will be virtual workshops
      hosted by Technica organizers that will help brief hackers on the various
      opportunities that the tracks offer. We highly recommend hackers to
      attend!
      <br>
      <br>
      Please note that some tracks may have limited capacity, and may be limited
      to specific attendance types.
